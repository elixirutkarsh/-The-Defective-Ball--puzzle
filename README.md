# -The-Defective-Ball--puzzle
Problem Statement: You have 10 identical-looking balls, and one of them is defective. The defective ball weighs slightly less or slightly more than the others, but you don't know which. Using a balance scale only twice, determine which ball is defective and whether it is heavier or lighter.
Solution: To solve this problem, follow these steps:

Divide the 10 balls into three groups: Group A with three balls, Group B with three balls, and Group C with four balls.

Weigh Group A against Group B using the balance scale:

If they balance, the defective ball is in Group C. Move to step 2.
If they don't balance, proceed to step 3.
Take the heavier group from the weighing (either Group A or Group B) and select any two balls from that group. Weigh them against each other:

If they balance, the remaining ball in the heavier group is the defective one, and you can determine its weight by comparing it to any known good ball.
If they don't balance, the scale will tilt towards the heavier ball, indicating that it is the defective one. You can then determine if it is heavier or lighter by comparing it to any known good ball.
